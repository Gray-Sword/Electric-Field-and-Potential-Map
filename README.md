# Electric-Field-and-Potential-Map
This project visualizes the electric field and potential map generated by a point charge using Python. It calculates the electric field vectors and potential values at each point on a 2D grid and displays them with a vector field and contour plot, providing an intuitive representation of electrostatic phenomena.
