# Electric Field and Potential Map

## Description
This project visualizes the electric field and potential map produced by a point charge using Python. The simulation calculates the electric field vectors and electric potential at each point on a 2D grid, then displays them using vector field and contour plots.

## Features
- **Electric Field**: Displays the electric field vectors with the direction and magnitude at each point on the grid.
- **Electric Potential**: Shows the electric potential as a contour map, with different colors representing varying potential values.
- **Interactive**: The grid size, charge magnitude, and other parameters can be easily modified to simulate different scenarios.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy` library
- `matplotlib` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
